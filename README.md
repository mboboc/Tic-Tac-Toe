## Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

I wanted to make the game in the console but every time a player moved, he needed to specify the position of the grid he wants to mark with O/X. I considered it to be very tedious so I added a GUI grid where you can click on the cell you wanna mark.
The state of the game is printed in the console after each move.

I used the Tkinter library which can be installed on Unix with this command:

*sudo apt-get install python3-tk*
